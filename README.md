# li-mao.net

The source code of my personal website. 
www.li-mao.net.

This website is constructed out of html5up template, but many modifications have been added. 

## Update June 4:
My website is currently under complete reconstruction. The objective is to use React to create
more easily managable pages and include more project details. Stay tuned.
